# nixcode-ai Project Analysis

## Project Overview

nixcode-ai is a terminal-based client for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs), with a primary focus on Claude AI by Anthropic. It's a Rust-based TUI (Text User Interface) application that provides a modern, terminal-friendly interface for communicating with AI assistants directly from the command line. The application features a vim-inspired input system, a chat interface, and an innovative tool invocation framework that allows the AI to use external tools.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture organized as a Rust workspace with multiple packages:

1. **Main Application (apps/nixcode-cli)**: The terminal interface and user interaction layer
2. **LLM SDK Library (libs/llm_sdk)**: API client for LLM providers (currently Anthropic, with plans for OpenAI, etc.)
3. **Core Library (libs/nixcode)**: Core functionality including tools and utilities
4. **Procedural Macros (libs/nixcode-macros)**: Custom macros for the project

The application follows an event-driven architecture where:
- UI events are captured and processed by the main app
- Commands and messages flow through an event channel system
- Async tasks handle LLM communication
- Tool invocations are processed in a dedicated system

### Communication Flow

1. User input → App → LLM SDK → LLM Provider (Anthropic)
2. LLM Response → SDK → App → UI
3. Tool invocations: LLM Request → Tool Execution → Results → LLM

## Key Components

### Apps

#### nixcode-cli (Terminal Interface)
- **app.rs**: Main application logic and event loop
- **input_mode.rs**: Implements Vim-inspired input modes (Normal, Insert, Command)
- **widgets/chat.rs**: Chat interface implementation
- **command_popup.rs**: Command popup UI for executing special commands
- **user_input.rs**: Text input handling
- **status_bar.rs**: Status bar displaying the current input mode, application version, and date/time
- **popup_utils.rs**: Utilities for creating and positioning popup dialogs in the UI

### Libraries

#### llm_sdk (LLM Client SDK)
- **lib.rs**: Core client implementation and API
- **message/**: Message structure and handling
- **providers.rs**: LLM provider integration (Anthropic, with planned support for others)
- **tools.rs**: Tool definition system for LLM function calling

#### nixcode (Core Utilities)
- **tools/**: Tool implementation (filesystem operations, glob search, git, etc.)
- **project/**: Project management functionality
- **prompts/**: System prompts and templates
- **utils/**: Utility functions

#### nixcode-macros
- Procedural macros for simplifying tool definitions

### Tool System

The tool system is a key architectural feature allowing the LLM to:
1. Request tool use through a standardized JSON interface
2. Have tools executed by the application
3. Receive results back to continue the conversation

This enables capabilities like file searching, content reading/writing, and more.

#### Available Tools
The project implements several tools in the `libs/nixcode/src/tools/` directory:
- **fs.rs**: File system operations (reading, writing, creating, deleting files)
- **git.rs**: Git operations (status, add, commit, diff)
- **glob.rs**: Glob pattern file searching
- **search_content.rs**: Content searching within files
- **replace_content.rs**: Find and replace content in files
- **content_utils.rs**: Utility functions for content manipulation
- **prompt.rs**: Prompt-related utilities

All tools implement the `Tool` trait defined in `tools/mod.rs`, which provides a standardized interface for tool registration, schema definition, and execution.

## Workflow

1. **User Input Flow**:
   - User types in the terminal interface
   - Input is processed based on the current input mode (Normal, Insert, Command)
   - Commands are executed or messages are sent to the LLM

2. **LLM Interaction Flow**:
   - Messages are sent to the LLM via the Anthropic API
   - Responses are streamed back and displayed progressively
   - Events are dispatched through the app event channel
   - Input costs are tracked and displayed

3. **Tool Execution Flow**:
   - LLM response may include tool invocation requests
   - Tool requests are identified and executed
   - Results are sent back to the LLM
   - Conversation continues with tool output context

## Technology Stack

### Programming Languages and Core Frameworks
- **Rust**: Primary language
- **ratatui**: Terminal UI framework
- **tokio**: Async runtime
- **crossterm**: Terminal handling

### External APIs
- **Anthropic API**: For Claude AI integration
- **Planned integrations**: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Groq

### Key Dependencies
- **reqwest**: HTTP client for API communication
- **serde**: Serialization/deserialization
- **tokio-stream**: Async streaming
- **anyhow**: Error handling
- **secrecy**: Secure credential handling
- **eventsource-stream**: Server-sent events handling
- **chrono**: Date and time handling for the status bar

## Organization Patterns

### File Structure
- Workspace-based organization with clear separation between app and libraries
- Modular approach with specific responsibilities per module
- Feature-based organization within each package

### Code Conventions
- Standard Rust naming conventions (snake_case for variables/functions, CamelCase for types)
- Trait-based abstractions for flexibility
- Event-driven architecture for UI and async operations
- Clear separation between UI rendering and business logic
- Angular Commit Convention for git commit messages

### Git Commit Convention
The project follows the Angular Commit Convention for consistent and descriptive commit messages:
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Types include: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, etc.
- Examples:
  - `feat(tools): add filesystem search capability`
  - `fix(ui): resolve chat scrolling issue`
  - `docs(readme): update installation instructions`
- Commit messages should clearly describe what changes were made and why
- This convention helps with automated changelog generation and versioning

### Data Flow Patterns
- Message-passing between components
- Event channels for async communication
- Streaming responses from LLM
- Tool invocation via standardized interfaces

## Recommendations

1. **Understanding the Tool System**: The tool system is a key component for AI function-calling. Understanding the interaction between `libs/nixcode/src/tools/` and `libs/llm_sdk/src/message/content/tools.rs` is crucial.

2. **Event Flow**: The app uses an event-based system with `AppEvent` enums and channels. Understanding this flow helps with making modifications.

3. **UI Rendering**: The TUI rendering in `apps/nixcode-cli/src/widgets/` follows ratatui patterns with careful state management for scrolling and layout.

4. **LLM Integration**: Study `libs/llm_sdk/src/lib.rs` to understand how the application communicates with LLM providers, especially for streaming responses.

5. **Authentication**: Note that the app requires an Anthropic API key set as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment.

6. **Adding Features**: When adding new functionality, follow the existing modular patterns:
   - For new tools, add to `libs/nixcode/src/tools/`
   - For UI components, extend `apps/nixcode-cli/src/widgets/`
   - For LLM provider integrations, update `libs/llm_sdk/src/providers.rs`

7. **Testing**: The codebase includes some test patterns in the tools modules that can be followed for adding new tests.

8. **Documentation Maintenance**: When adding, modifying, or removing features that affect the project structure (new tools, UI components, libraries, etc.), update this analysis document (`.nixcode/init.md`) to ensure it remains accurate and useful for new developers. Outdated documentation can lead to confusion and slower onboarding.

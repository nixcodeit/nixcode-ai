# nixcode-ai Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and maintainers of the nixcode-ai project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, focused on advancing the capabilities of terminal-based AI interaction tools.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Providing meaningful and detailed commit messages and documentation
* Following established coding standards and patterns
* Respecting the project's vim-inspired design philosophy
* Contributing to the tool invocation framework thoughtfully

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Introducing security vulnerabilities or breaking the established tool security models
* Modifying the project to circumvent the license restrictions
* Submitting code that significantly deviates from the project's architectural vision
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Technical Guidelines

As nixcode-ai is a specialized terminal-based AI interaction tool, we also have specific technical conduct guidelines:

1. **Respect the Project Architecture**: Follow the established workspace structure with separate apps and libraries.
2. **Security First**: When implementing features involving API keys or external connections, always prioritize security.
3. **Terminal Efficiency**: Code should be optimized for terminal performance and responsiveness.
4. **Vim Philosophy**: Respect and maintain the vim-inspired input modes and workflows.
5. **Tool Framework Integrity**: When extending the tool invocation framework, ensure tools follow the established patterns and security models.
6. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality standards with proper error handling, documentation, and tests.
7. **Licensing Compliance**: Respect the project's source-available license and ensure all contributions comply with it.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, issue trackers, discussions, and any other forums created for the community. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at kontakt@nixcode.it. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Technical Violation Guidelines

For technical violations that affect the project's integrity:

### 1. Technical Warning

**Impact**: Code contributions that moderately deviate from project standards or architecture.

**Consequence**: Pull request will not be accepted until fixed, with detailed guidance provided by maintainers.

### 2. Implementation Review Requirement

**Impact**: Repeated submissions that don't follow project patterns or security practices.

**Consequence**: Future submissions will require pre-approval of the implementation approach before work begins.

### 3. Contribution Restriction

**Impact**: Intentional introduction of security vulnerabilities or licensing violations.

**Consequence**: Restricted to specific types of contributions with mandatory code review, or temporary suspension of contribution privileges.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html).

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

## Project-Specific Addendums

### LLM Integration Ethical Guidelines

As nixcode-ai integrates with Large Language Models (particularly Claude AI):

1. **Responsible AI Use**: Contributors should promote responsible use of AI tools and not design features that could facilitate misuse.
2. **Data Privacy**: Always respect user data privacy when implementing features that process user inputs.
3. **Transparency**: Be transparent about AI capabilities and limitations in documentation.
4. **Inclusivity**: Ensure the terminal interface remains accessible to users with diverse needs.

### License Compliance

All contributors must understand and comply with the nixcode-ai Source-Available License, which restricts commercial use without explicit permission from the copyright holder.
